# Random-Walk
Simple Monte Carlo Simulation with Random Walk

Task: What is the longest random walk you can take so that on average you will end up 4 blocks or fewer from home? Use the Monte Carlo Simulation.
In other words: Find the longest walk where there's a probablility of minimum 50% of being less than 4 blocks away from the starting point.
